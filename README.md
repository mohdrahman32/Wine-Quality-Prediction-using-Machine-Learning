## Project Overview
The project explores multiple ML algorithms to determine which performs best for wine quality prediction. The workflow includes:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Model Training & Evaluation
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Model Comparison

## Dataset
- **Source:** Wine_Quality.csv
- **Rows:** 1599
- **Columns:** 12 numeric features + 1 target (`quality`)
- **Target:** `quality` (score 0‚Äì10)
- **Notes:** ID column removed before processing.

## Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn (model_selection, metrics, preprocessing, linear_model, neighbors, naive_bayes, tree, svm)

## Features
The dataset includes chemical properties like:
- Fixed Acidity
- Volatile Acidity
- Citric Acid
- Residual Sugar
- Chlorides
- Free Sulfur Dioxide
- Total Sulfur Dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- Quality (Target)

## Machine Learning Models
- **Linear Regression** ‚Äì Predict continuous wine quality
- **Logistic Regression** ‚Äì Classify wine quality categories
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** ‚Äì Distance-based classification
- **Naive Bayes (Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli)** ‚Äì Probabilistic classifiers
- **Decision Tree Regressor** ‚Äì Feature importance and regression
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** ‚Äì Classification with RBF kernel

## Hyperparameter Tuning
- Performed using `GridSearchCV` for:
  - Logistic Regression (`C`, `solver`, `penalty`)
  - KNN (`n_neighbors`, `weights`, `metric`)
  - Linear Regression (`fit_intercept`, `positive`)
- 5-fold cross-validation used

## Results
| Model | Metric | Score |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Logistic Regression | Accuracy | 0.XXX |
| KNN | Accuracy | 0.XXX |
| Linear Regression | R2 | 0.XXX |

- **Best Performer:** KNN/Logistic Regression (based on final evaluation)
- Demonstrates full ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation

## Future Enhancements
- Implement ensemble models like Random Forest, XGBoost
- Feature scaling and selection for improved accuracy
- Evaluate on larger, diverse datasets
- Deploy as web-based prediction app

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohdrahman32/Wine-Quality-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning.git
````
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis and model results.
